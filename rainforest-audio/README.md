# Classifying Endangered Birds From the Prek Toal Reserve

The goal of this project was to build an image classifier that identifies different endangered waterbird species present throughout the Prek Toal Reserve in Cambodia. This classifier has the potential to bring support to NGOs such as [Osmose](http://osmosetonlesap.net/wp/index.php/en/home/) which ensure the protection of waterbird colonies throughout the reproductive cycle. Data was collected using Google Images.
