## Automate the detection of bird and frog species in a tropical soundscape

Rainforest Connection (RFCx) created the worldâ€™s first scalable, real-time monitoring system for protecting and studying remote ecosystems. Unlike visual-based tracking systems like drones or satellites, RFCx relies on acoustic sensors that monitor the ecosystem soundscape at selected locations year round. RFCx technology has advanced to support a comprehensive biodiversity monitoring program that allows local partners to measure progress of wildlife restoration and recovery through principles of adaptive management.

The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model to automate the detection of bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings, as part of a Kaggle competition. The models had to be created with limited, acoustically complex training data. My best submission scored a label-weighted label-ranking average precision of 0.71 on the private leaderboard.
