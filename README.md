# Deep Learning Projects: Leveraging `fastai v2`

This repository contains different deep learning project notebooks that were run using the fastai framework. 

## Structure

Here is a list of the projects contained in this repository, classified according to the domain they belong to.

**Vision:**

- **[rainforest-audio](https://github.com/luca-martial/fastai-v2-projects/tree/main/rainforest-audio)**: The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model to automate the detection of bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings, as part of a Kaggle competition. The models had to be created with limited, acoustically complex training data. My best submission scored a label-weighted label-ranking average precision of 0.71 on the private leaderboard.
