# Deep Learning Projects: Leveraging `fastai v1`

This repository contains different deep learning project notebooks that were run using the fastai framework. 

## Structure

Here is a list of the projects contained in this repository, classified according to the deep learning domain they belong to.

**Vision:**

- **[mask-wear](https://github.com/luca-martial/fastai-projects/tree/master/mask-wear)**: The goal of this project was to build an image classifier that identifies whether a person is wearing their mask properly or imporperly. Data was collected using Google Images. 

- **[osmose-birds](https://github.com/luca-martial/fastai-projects/tree/master/osmose-birds)**: The goal of this project was to build an image classifier that identifies different endangered waterbird species present throughout the Prek Toal Reserve in Cambodia. This classifier has the potential to bring support to NGOs such as [Osmose](http://osmosetonlesap.net/wp/index.php/en/home/) which ensure the protection of waterbird colonies throughout the reproductive cycle. Data was collected using Google Images. 

**NLP:**

- **[nlp-tweets](https://github.com/luca-martial/fastai-projects/tree/master/nlp-tweets)**: The goal of this project was to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones arenâ€™t. I had access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. This project was part of a Kaggle competition where I scored a 79.5% accuracy.
